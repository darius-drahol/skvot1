        <blockquote>“Matisse is a painter! However - only for a carpet and not more. Build the shape geometrically, cubically, divide it into planes and faces, - said Krychevsky. Don't take photos for me."
        </blockquote>

        <p>The monumental triptych "Life" (1925-1927) is the brightest example of Ukrainian modernism by Krychevsky, in which the stylistics of Ukrainian icon painting is combined with elements of Art Nouveau. 
             In his works, the influence of European Art Nouveau artists - Klimt, Moser, Hodler - is clearly traced. 
            Empty background, local colors, flatness, inherent iconography, enriched in the triptych with graceful rhythm and flexible lines characteristic of Art Nouveau.
        </p>

        <p>This work depicts the Ukrainian everyday life of that time, but through traditional images speaks of global universal themes: the joy of peaceful life and the tragedy of war. 
            The left part of the triptych is called "Love" - ​​it is a happy existence, the beginning of a new life;
            the central part of the "Family" - the basis of the composition and the main value of life; 
            the right part of "Return" - shows the drama of life: parents who meet returned from the front of his son - without a leg, but with a St. George's cross. 
        </p>

        <p>The triptych was exhibited at many exhibitions, both in Ukraine and abroad: "Return" in 1933 was included in the exhibition of Soviet art in Copenhagen and Warsaw, and the central part of the triptych "Family" was  at the Venice Biennale in 1928 in the Soviet pavilion.
